# Crawler
  - Our final project for Fall 2016 Data Structures is a .html visualization of a web crawler that 
  operates on the nd.edu domain. We used a python program, crawler.py, to create an **adjacency 
  list** from the link tags on each webpage. We ran crawler.py with a depth of 1 and 2 and 
  stored the results in two text files, a_list_large.txt and a_list_small.txt respectively. After 
  storing these results, we ran a simple server, server.py, and an .html page, index.html, that
  uses javascript and jquery to create a interactive, navigateable web graph. This graph 
  displays a url on the center bubble with all links on the center's webpage surrounding it.
  In addition, we added a **shortest path** computation and visualization below the web 
  visualization using Dijkstra's algorithm.
